# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0
- Make showcased widgets display fonts.

Following https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/17700, it's now possible to display fonts on golden files, so it is on showcase as well.

Showcase will use the Roboto font by trying to locate it on the filesystem package cache folder, or downloading it from the internet.

## 0.2.0
- Make generator create a `.showcased_test` file instead of `_test.showcased` https://github.com/Igor1201/showcase/pull/7.

## 0.1.0
- Beta. Use with caution, lots of missing features.
